# Energize Analytics

**Energize Analytics is a vision: a Java-based project aimed at analyzing energy data and understanding the influence of socio-economic and geographic factors on energy transformation.**

---

## 🌟 **Overview**
Energize Analytics seeks to explore how various factors such as socio-economic conditions, geography, and climate influence energy production, consumption, and transformation. The project provides a data-driven perspective to uncover insights into energy systems and their evolution.

This project is currently in development and focuses on **EU countries**, using data sourced from **Eurostat**. The design is flexible and prepared for future global expansion and integration of additional data sources.

---

## 🏗️ **Current Status**
- Developing foundational data models for energy types (e.g., Solar, Wind, Biomass).
- Building an API client for seamless data integration from Eurostat.
- Structuring the codebase to support analysis and comparisons across countries.

---

## 🚀 **Future Vision**
- Analyze energy transformations worldwide, considering diverse socio-economic contexts.
- Integrate climatic and geographic data to assess renewable energy potential.
- Enable advanced insights into global energy trends and transitions.
